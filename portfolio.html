          <p>Statistically check out the feelings of modern people who are forgotten in quick everyday life. You can organize your past feelings into a diary so that you can look back on the past and recall your memories. Emotional focus, not just diary writing, is characteristic, and emotion marks replace the day's memory.</p>

          <p>A service that prevents being out of tune and recommends songs that fit my vocal range. It was launched into the Google Play Store and was taken down now by a copyright issue. This project is made up of a team(four developers, one designer, and one organizer). I am in charge of front-end development. The app has the ability to measure the user's vocal range and recommend appropriate songs.</p>

      <h3 class="portfolioh3">3. Team Web Development Project - Pet and Met</h3>

        <div class="portfolioleft">
          <p>This service is a pet shopping mall. You can also buy a pet from a company or a p2p. There is a fixed price system and an auction system for p2p purchases. The reconnaissance system is sold by specifying the price the seller wants, and the auction system can be purchased by the person who has offered the higher price using the auction system. In the process, note function and comment function were implemented. The project member is made up of four developers.</p>
